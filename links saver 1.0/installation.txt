the files are:

*be sure to check that these file exist in the folder you downloaded*

step-2:
open your chrome browser and go to "chrome://extensions/".
this will show you all the extensions installed in your browser.

step-3:
now drag and drop the "links saver" folder in the extensions window.
and the installation is done!
it can be accessed through the puzzle type icon, besides your profile icon, along with the other extensions.
