"Links saver" is a chrome extension which can be used to store links that are important to you.
You can either paste a link and save it OR
you can save the address of the current tab you are working on.

I made while I was starting to learn javascript.
It's my first js project.
I have tried to make it user-friendly, but if you face any issue with it then you can contact me
at my instagram account '@simplesid_art' [i'm not available anywhere else] OR you can list it as an issue here.

I'll keep updating the features as I progress through my learning.
